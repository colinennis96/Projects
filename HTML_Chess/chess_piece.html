          Pawns are valued at a +1.

      Knight - Knights can move in two ways; vertically two spaces and horizontally one
           to the left or one to the right, and horinzontally two spaces and one vertically up or down. Knights can move in this L shape in any direction and can at certain spaces in the board have 8 total moves at any given moment.
           Knights are valued at a +3.
