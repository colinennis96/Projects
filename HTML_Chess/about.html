      <h1>CINS 465: Assignment 4 by Colin Ennis</h1>
      <p1>
        My name is Colin Ennis and I am 24 years old. I was born in Sacramento, California and have lived in the state my whole life. I've had a passion for technology from day one and decided to pursue that passion at CSU-Chico while majoring in Computer Information Systems.

        This assignment was fairly easy to implement. I started by adding the boostrap bar to each HTML page and correcting the links for current page and home which would always be the chessboard. All that was left to do was to add content to each of the individual HTML pages.
